ResQ - AI-Powered QR-Based Healthcare System 🏥🔍

ResQ is an AI-driven healthcare management system that leverages QR codes, OpenAI-powered summarization, and intelligent document verification to streamline patient data retrieval, diagnosis storage, and appointment scheduling. The system ensures fast, secure, and offline-accessible medical records for doctors while providing a seamless experience for patients.

In rural areas, medical data retrieval is often hindered by poor internet connectivity. ResQ solves this by using a low-latency QR code system that enables doctors to scan and access patient data offline, updating records once connectivity is restored. Additionally, AI-powered verification ensures prescriptions and medical reports are authentic, preventing fraudulent uploads.
